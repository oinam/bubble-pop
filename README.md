Project Name: "Pop the Bubbles from the Wrap"

Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for Bubble popping game for a Bubble Wrap like experience.

There are about 3 varying pop sounds, which is tiny in size and extremely short.

Make the visual as realistic as possible. Perhaps use tiled PNG images of unpopped bubbles, and when clicked they popped into various popped states. Make sure to have the background and images blend seamlessly. I will figure out the source of the image myself.

Header is a dark background with light colored text. It has a Nav Bar with the title "Pop the Bubbles from the Wrap" and a counter that shows the nummber of bubbles popped. The header is fixed, so it stays there when users scroll the browser. The counter design should be simple plain text, while highlight the number.

The remainder after the header is covered in an unlimited bubbles that a user can keep scrolling to pop them.
